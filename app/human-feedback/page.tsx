        <h2 className="tet-2xl font-bold mt-8">Why?</h2>
        <p className="text-sm pt-2 pb-0">
          Commercial chatbots get to train on feedback from live users on their
          platform. We want open models and local AI systems to get the same
          opportunity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm pt-2 pb-0">
          In the near future we'll significantly amplify our cognitive
          capability with AI. To some degree we already do this with search
          engines and some of the early chatbots. In the near future we'll be
          10x smarter by fluidly passing data back and forth between our brains
          and models. However, the AI systems must be private and secure for us
          to feel comfortable enough using it. Open models that we can run
          locally on our own devices offer a promissing path to this future.

          For app developers, Otherbrain HF is an easy path to integrate
          anonymous <span className="inline-block">üëçüëé</span> feedback
          collection in your app. Just POST a chat then redirect to have the
          user label it. If you have an app you'd like to add, contact us for
          help. We'll make sure your client is correctly linked and attributed.

          Are you training an open model that could benefit from the Otherbrain
          HF dataset? It's small right now ({count} chats) but growing every
          day. Contact us for access. When the dataset grows enough to be
          useful, we'll add automated dumps to Hugging Face.
